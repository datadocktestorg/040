An inn named \"le Swan\" had been established on the site by 1463. It was leased to George Grey (who had leased the Three Cups in Wine Street from St. James Priory) by Nicholas Willyams, tailor, later a mayor of Bristol (in 1564) (Leech 1997, 102). Williams bequeathed the leases and interest of \"the tenement called \"the Swanne\"\" to his wife Joan in his will of 1 September 1565, and the building was then recorded still to be in the tenure of George Graye (Wadley 1886, 225). The property had been acquired by the foeffees of Trinity Hospital in Old Market by 1581. It remained an inn, however, throughout.\nThe form of the building before the seventeenth century is unknown. However, a lane ran through the site between Mary le Port Street and Wine Street by 1615. An inventory of the property of the tenant Thomas Collier made in October 1647 recorded that the inn had eleven bedrooms, as well as two halls, the \"Upper Hawll\" and the \"Lower Hawll\", kitchen and hayloft (George & George 2002, 159-162). By 1670 the inn was known as the \"White Swan.\" The property was subsequently acquired by the Bristol Corporation which sold it in 1730. The building was then demolished to allow the construction of \"a Market Place for corn in Wine Street\" (Leech 1997, 103) and this later became the Cheese Market."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/040/id/dataset/bristolMonumentsSubset>.

The building is the southernmost of a terrace of nineteen houses. The plot, formerly part of the grounds associated with Clifton Hill House, was leased from the Society of Merchant Venturers by Harry Elderton in 1792 for a term of forty years (Ison 1952, 234). Construction of the terrace began under the supervision of William Paty (Priest 2003, 101) but was abandoned in 1793 when the outbreak of war caused a slump in development. The buildings remained uncompleted for nearly two decades but the terrace had apparently been completed by 1815."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/040/id/dataset/bristolMonumentsSubset>.
