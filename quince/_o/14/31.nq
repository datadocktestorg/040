The gate was part of the Norman inner circuit town wall and was an elaborate three-way gate with a T-shaped plan. One arch led into Corn Street, one to the northern end of the original line of Baldwin Street, and the third to the southern end of Fisher Lane (now the northern section of St. Stephen's Street). The church of St. Leonard (BUAD 668M) was above the gate. The gate was removed in 1771 to make way for the creation of Clare Street."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/040/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
