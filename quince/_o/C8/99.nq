The building was a jettied house of seventeenth-century date. It was of three storeys plus attic with a gabled roof. 2-window range. First and second floors jettied. Second-floor and attic slate-hung. 2 windows to second-floor, 1 sash to attic. Lateral stacks.\nThe plot was owned by the Corporation and in 1532 it was occupied by Henry Cooper. The occupiers of the property through the sixteenth and into the mid-seventeenth-century can be traced from property records (Leech 1997, 110). A new lease was granted to Francis Atwood in 1653 (BRO 04041 fo.19) who was presumably responsible for rebuilding (or possibly simply refronting) the house. By 1738 it had been leased to Jeremiah Ames, a grocer. The building survived into the early twentieth century and appears to have demolished as part of the clearance of the area after the Second World War."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/datadocktestorg/040/id/dataset/bristolMonumentscsv>.
